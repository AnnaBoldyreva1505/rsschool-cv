### About Myself:
I'm a junior Fullstack developer, and my interest in web development sparked when I worked as a knowledge base administrator. It was during that time that I first got introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, reshaping my perspective on the possibilities of web technologies.

Since then, I've been actively learning and striving to become a professional Fullstack developer. My efforts are geared towards immersing myself in the world of web development, both on the front end and back end, and I'm committed to expanding my skills to contribute effectively to web development projects.
